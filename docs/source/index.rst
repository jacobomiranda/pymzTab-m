Welcome to pymzTab-m's documentation!
=====================================

This is the mzTab-M reference implementation and validation API service for Python 3.

.. note:: This is an early development version, please use at your own risk and report issues to help improve it!

mzTab-M is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results from metabolomics/lipodomics approaches. This format is further intended to provide local LIMS systems as well as MS metabolomics repositories a simple way to share and combine basic information.

mzTab-M has been developed with a view to support the following general tasks:

* Facilitate the sharing of final experimental results, especially with researchers outside the field of metabolomics.
* Export of results to external software, including programs such as Microsoft ExcelÂ® and Open Office Spreadsheet and statistical software / coding languages such as R and Python.
* Act as an output format of (web-) services that report MS-based results and thus can produce standardized result pages.
* Be able to link to the external experimental evidence e.g. by referencing back to mzML files.

Getting Started
===============

The following example shows how to validate an MzTab object using the REST API for the `jmzTab-M webapplication REST service <https://apps.lifs.isas.de/mztabvalidator/swagger-ui.html>`_

.. note:: In this example, the MzTab object will not validate! Please check `the test API test <https://github.com/lifs-tools/pymzTab-m/blob/master/tests/swagger_client/test_validate_api.py>`_ for a more realistic example.

.. code-block:: python

	from __future__ import print_function
	import time
	import swagger_client
	from swagger_client.rest import ApiException
	from pprint import pprint

	# create an instance of the API class
	api_instance = swagger_client.ValidateApi(swagger_client.ApiClient(configuration))
	mztabfile = swagger_client.MzTab() # MzTab | mzTab file that should be validated. This still needs to be populated!!!
	level = 'info' # str | The level of errors that should be reported, one of ERROR, WARN, INFO. (optional) (default to info)
	max_errors = 100 # int | The maximum number of errors to return. (optional) (default to 100)
	semantic_validation = false # bool | Whether a semantic validation against the default rule set should be performed. (optional) (default to false)

	try:
	    api_response = api_instance.validate_mz_tab_file(mztabfile, level=level, max_errors=max_errors, semantic_validation=semantic_validation)
	    pprint(api_response)
	except ApiException as e:
	    print("Exception when calling ValidateApi->validate_mz_tab_file: %s\n" % e)
