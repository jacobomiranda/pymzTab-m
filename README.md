# Python3 implementation for mzTab-M
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lifs-tools/pymzTab-m.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lifs-tools/pymzTab-m)

This is the mzTab-M reference implementation and validation API service for Python 3.

> **_NOTE:_**  This is an *early* development version, please use at your own risk and report issues to help improve it!

mzTab-M is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results from metabolomics/lipodomics approaches. This format is further intended to provide local LIMS systems as well as MS metabolomics repositories a simple way to share and combine basic information.

mzTab-M has been developed with a view to support the following general tasks:

1. Facilitate the sharing of final experimental results, especially with researchers outside the field of metabolomics.
2. Export of results to external software, including programs such as Microsoft ExcelÂ® and Open Office Spreadsheet and statistical software / coding languages such as R.
3. Act as an output format of (web-) services that report MS-based results and thus can produce standardized result pages.
4. Be able to link to the external experimental evidence e.g. by referencing back to mzML files.

## Overview
This API client was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [OpenAPI/Swagger spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) from a remote server, you can easily generate an API client.

- API version: 2.0.0
- Package version: 1.0.0

## Installation

The `pymztab_m` package is currently available from [Test PyPi](https://test.pypi.org/project/pymztab_m_IaaIaaSPDR/).

To install it, run 

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pymztab-m-IaaIaaSPDR
```

This will install the package into your user site-packages directory.

To import it, you can import the following two modules:

- `mztab_m_io` - Parser implementation for mzTab-M tab separated clear text format.
- `mztab_m_swagger_client` - Domain model and REST Api to use the [mzTab-M validator webapplication](https://apps.lifs.isas.de/mztabvalidator)

Please have a look at the unit tests (`tests` directory) for some examples!

## Building the Package from Source

### Prerequisites
The pymzTab-m package uses pipenv to create an isolated and defined build environment. You will need Python >=3.5 to build the package.

```
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv install
```

Activate the pipenv:

```
pipenv shell
```

or use

```
pipenv run
```

to run commands inside the project directory.

### Running the tests

To run the package tests, change into the pipenv and run pytest:

```
pytest
```

Alternatively, you can use the setup.py script:

```
python3 setup.py test
```
### Preparing a distribution

Check that setuptools and wheel are installed and up to date:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
```

Build the distribution package:

```
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

### Building the documentation

The documentation is built using Sphinx. If not installed, you can install it and a default theme with:

```
pip3 install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```

Then change to the docs folder and run:

```
make html
```

in order to create the html documentation.
